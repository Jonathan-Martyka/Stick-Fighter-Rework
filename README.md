# Stick-Fighter-Rework

Reworking and refactoring a game I made for Independent Study in high school using Java Applet back in 2016.
This project was originally presented at the 2016 Student Technology Leadership Summit at Maine East High School.

Through editing this old work of mine, I hope to show improvement in some of my techniques and apply some of what I've learned.
